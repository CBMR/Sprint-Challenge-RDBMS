1. Explain the difference between `RDBMS` and `SQL`.
  * RDBMS is a database that stores data in a tabular format with rows and columns.
  * SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is the language used to manage databases and its data. In other words, it is how we interact with the database.
1. Why do tables need a `primary key`?
  * Because it is the only way to uniquely identify each record in the table. Since multiple records can have similar data.
1. What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
  * Foreign Keys
1. What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two tables.
  * A third table with foreign keys that holds the primary key on the related tables.
